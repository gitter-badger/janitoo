==================
Welcome to Janitoo
==================

Not another Home Automation software ... a full protocol

A video of presentation is available on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Gqj32sJ-Q

What is Janitoo
===============


Network
-------

A network in Janitoo is holded by Mosquitto.
It use the Dynamic Home Configuration Protocol to allow nodes to communicate each other.

Each node on a network has its own HADD : xxxx/yyyy where 0 <= x,y <=9.

Nodes with an HADD ending in 0000 (ie 1234/0000) are called controllers.
They are responsible of the nodes in their subnetwork (ie 1234/0001).


Supervisors
-----------

Supervisors maintains a "map" of the network.
There are of 2 types : primaries and secondaries.

The primary will serve configuration parameters for the nodes.

The network is managed by a finish state machine. Only the fail mode can be considered as usuable.


Controllers, nodes and values
-----------------------------

A node holds values.

There is many genres of values :
 - system : needed by the protocol itself.
 - config : used to configure nodes and values
 - basic : base values. Used by nodes themselves and andvanced users.
 - user : for common users
 - command : to launch advanced commands ie pairing

Examples of nodes/values

- an ups is a node (janitoo_nut). battery_level, upsstate, ... are values
- a vacuum is a node (janitoo_roomba). baterry_level, dock state but also clean, dock commands are values
- an rrd source is a node
- an arduino is a node

...

If your familiar with openzwave and the zwave protocol, janitoo is a kind of zwave over mqtt.

Bus and components
------------------

Ths bus and components are the developpers API of the nodes in Janitoo.

A bus can hold components and is associated to a controller
A component is mapped to a node.
The map is done using a configuration file

Multi_hardware
--------------
Due to its low memory footprint, janitoo can be used on many hardwares :

- Arduino mega. Actually, it's impossible to install it on an Uno.
- Raspberry : the 0 will be supported (python). The janitoo_hostsensor with 7 nodes and about 100 values only takes 3% of memory and 7% of cpu on a Raspberry B.
